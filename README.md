# Problems Dr.Docs solves

 1.	Difficulty in diagnosing a patient without previous medical history/records.
 2.	Difficulty in keeping a lot of records together and finding them when needed.
 3.	Unfiltered , unsorted, untagged record data.
 4.	Unsecure transferring of records, increased chances of misuse of the records, or unauthorised  sharing  of data to third party.
 5.	Very few digital records of the report.
 
#Solutions : 
 1.	Our solution will keep a full medical record of the previous checkups, medications , reports,
    Which will be accessable efficiently on demand of the patient to next doctor/hospital.
 2.	All records will be at a single place, accessable at fingertips.
 3.	Collections of records will be filterable according to different filters which will make it super easy to get the record the patient wants in seconds.
 4.		Only by using your biometrics or your E-repo card will give the access to the records, its up to you who to give access to, securely.
 5.	With this, your medical records will be stored in a digital manner.
